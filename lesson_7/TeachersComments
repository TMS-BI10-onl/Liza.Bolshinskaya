Well done!

A -0.5
I can't understand your id and numbers in the 3nf. :(

B -0.5
Educational number can be a PK itself.
Also, all these fields are about a student. We don't need to divide them to different tables.

D -0.5
Correct answer: 2nf
2nf is not about adding personal id's, it's about adding general id=pk.

E -0.5
Same.

F -0.25
We're deleting calculated fields when moving to the 3nf.
