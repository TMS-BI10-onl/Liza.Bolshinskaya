Well done!

1. -0.25
Error: ambiguous column name. You need to specify from which table you're taking names.

3. -0.25
Not the easiest way here. With top and order it can be solved in one query.

4. -1
Can be solved in one query, not in 3, with window functions.

5. -0.5
End_date can be null, you need to handle it. Also, why do we need a subquery? Datediff is perfectly working in the where clause.

6. -0.25
Why do we need a group by?

Mark: 8

Test notes:
KPI font is not the same. The font size is too small.
Count of movies - Axis titles are not changed. What is a better filter for last 25 years: create a filter by release_date (not release date year), select relative date filtering and then type "in the last 25 years".
Top 5 genres - numbers don't match. You should use gross_with_inflation as a value.
No dividing lines between buttons.
Bottom left table - I don't want to see a scroll option. You could make first column smaller.
Also, it was mentioned that it needed to be one page with 2 views.

Test mark: 8
