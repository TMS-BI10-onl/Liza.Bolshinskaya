Correct answer:

SELECT Название
FROM Фирмы-производители 
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT преп.id_фирмы
				FROM Фармпрепараты преп
						JOIN Продажи прод ON преп.id=прод.id_фармпрепарата
						JOIN Кассовые_чеки чек ON прод.id_чека=чек.id 
				WHERE YEAR(Дата)=2019)
b) -1
Your query won't work. First of all, there is no table in the FROM clause in the subquery.
Secondly, the task is not about this. :)

c) -1
Why do you need group by if you don't have aggregative function? It'll cause an error.
Also, you're trying to count number of sold products. But we are looking for all products in the db.

Mark: 7-4=3
+3 for task 4

I almost commited files with marks, but wanted to give you one last chance to add part 2. And you did it! Lucky you :)
